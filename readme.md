## 🛰️ OpenAI Proxy Integration (Online Q&A)

NEBedu supports secure, online Q&A using [OpenAI](https://github.com/aa-sikkkk/NEBedu/wiki/OpenAI-Integration) models via a proxy server. This allows students to ask any question and get an answer from OpenAI, **without ever exposing the OpenAI API key to the user**.

### How It Works (for Students and Teachers)
- When you use the "Search with OpenAI (Online)" feature in NEBedu, your question is securely sent to a server.
- The server gets the answer from OpenAI and sends it back.
- **You do not need to set up or configure anything extra.**
- All server setup and security is handled by the responsible Stakeholders.

### What You Need to Do
- Just use NEBedu as normal.
- If online Q&A is enabled, you'll see the "Search with OpenAI (Online)" option in your menu.
- If it's not enabled, you can still use all offline features.

### Security & Privacy
- Your questions are sent securely to the server.
- The OpenAI API key is never stored on your computer or shared with you.
- Only the server communicates with OpenAI.

### Troubleshooting
- If you see a message like "[OpenAI Proxy Mock] ...", it means the online Q&A feature is not currently available. You can still use all offline features.
