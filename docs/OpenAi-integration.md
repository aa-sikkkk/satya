# OpenAI Proxy Integration Guide for Satya

## Overview

Satya supports secure, online Q&A using OpenAI models via a proxy server. This allows students to ask any question and get an answer from OpenAI, **without ever exposing the OpenAI API key to the user**. This guide details how the proxy integration works, how to set it up, and best practices for security and maintenance.

---

## 1. How the Proxy Works

### Architecture & Flow
- The Satya client app (student/teacher) sends questions to a secure proxy server (FastAPI-based).
- The proxy server authenticates requests using a `PROXY_AUTH_KEY` and uses its own `OPENAI_API_KEY` to call OpenAI.
- The answer is returned to the client. The OpenAI API key is **never** sent to or stored on the client.

**Diagram:**
```
[Student App] --(question + PROXY_AUTH_KEY)--> [Proxy Server] --(OPENAI_API_KEY)--> [OpenAI API]
      ^                                                                                 |
      |-------------------(answer) <---------------------------------------------------|
```

---

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities

- **Stakeholders/IT Admins:**
  - Set up and maintain the proxy server.
  - Manage environment variables and secrets.
  - Monitor usage and security.
- **Teachers/Students:**
  - Use the Satya app as normal. No server setup or configuration required.

---

## 3. Setting Up the Proxy Server

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI, Uvicorn, OpenAI Python SDK
- A secure server (cloud VM, on-prem, etc.)

### Installation
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn openai
```

### Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — Your OpenAI API key (never shared with users)
- `PROXY_AUTH_KEY` — A strong secret key for authenticating client requests

### Example: Running the Proxy Server
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your-openai-key...
export PROXY_AUTH_KEY=super-secret-proxy-key
uvicorn openai_proxy:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Security Configuration
- **HTTPS:** Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy) or cloud provider to serve over HTTPS.
- **CORS:** Restrict allowed origins in FastAPI:
  ```python
  ALLOWED_ORIGINS = ["https://yourdomain.com"]
  ```
- **Firewall:** Restrict access to only trusted networks if possible.

### Rate Limiting & Monitoring
- The proxy implements per-user rate limiting (default: 10 requests/minute/user).
- Monitor logs for abuse or unusual activity.

---

## 4. Configuring the Client (Student App)

- **No OpenAI API key is ever needed on the client.**
- Set the following environment variables on the client device:
  - `OPENAI_PROXY_URL` — The URL of your proxy server (e.g., `https://your-proxy.com/ask`)
  - `OPENAI_PROXY_KEY` — The value of `PROXY_AUTH_KEY` (to authenticate to the proxy)

### Example: Running the Client
```bash
export OPENAI_PROXY_URL=https://your-proxy.com/ask
export OPENAI_PROXY_KEY=super-secret-proxy-key
python -m student_app.interface.cli_interface
```

---

## 5. Security Best Practices

- **Never share the OpenAI API key with users.**
- Use a strong, unique `PROXY_AUTH_KEY` and rotate it periodically.
- Use HTTPS for all communications.
- Restrict CORS origins to trusted domains.
- Monitor and log all requests.
- Set up alerts for rate limit violations or suspicious activity.
- Regularly update dependencies and patch security vulnerabilities.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

- **Mock Answer Displayed:**
  - Cause: The client cannot reach the proxy server, or environment variables are not set.
  - Solution: Ensure the proxy is running and the client has correct `OPENAI_PROXY_URL` and `OPENAI_PROXY_KEY`.

- **Authentication Error:**
  - Cause: The `PROXY_AUTH_KEY` on the server and `OPENAI_PROXY_KEY` on the client do not match.
  - Solution: Update the client to use the correct key.

- **Rate Limit Exceeded:**
  - Cause: Too many requests from a user in a short time.
  - Solution: Wait and try again later.

- **CORS Error:**
  - Cause: The proxy server is not allowing requests from the client's domain.
  - Solution: Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in the proxy server config.

## 7. Example Flows

### Student Q&A (Success)
1. Student opens Satya and selects "Search with OpenAI (Online)".
2. Student enters a question.
3. The app sends the question to the proxy server with the `OPENAI_PROXY_KEY`.
4. The proxy authenticates, calls OpenAI, and returns the answer.
5. The student sees the answer in the app.

### Student Q&A (Proxy Down or Not Configured)
1. Student tries to use online Q&A.
2. The app cannot reach the proxy or is missing config.
3. The app displays a mock answer and suggests using offline features.

---

## 8. FAQ

**Q: Who should set up the proxy server?**
A: The Satya technical team or your school's IT administrator. Teachers and students do not need to set up or manage the server.

**Q: Is my OpenAI API key safe?**
A: Yes! The key is only stored on the proxy server and never shared with clients or users.

**Q: Can students or teachers use the online Q&A feature offline?**
A: No, online Q&A requires internet access and a running proxy server. All other features work offline.

**Q: How do I rotate the proxy key?**
A: Change `PROXY_AUTH_KEY` on the server and update `OPENAI_PROXY_KEY` on all clients.

**Q: What if the proxy is abused?**
A: Monitor logs, rotate keys, and restrict access as needed. Consider IP allow-listing for extra security.
