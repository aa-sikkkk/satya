*   **RAG-Enhanced AI-Powered Learning Assistance:**
    *   **Intelligent Content Discovery:** Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to find the most relevant study materials for any question, even with vague or incomplete queries.
    *   **Contextual Question Answering (Q&A):** Provides accurate and relevant answers to student queries using **Phi 1.5 model** with retrieved RAG context for enhanced accuracy.
    *   **Answer Length Control:** Students can choose from **5 different detail levels** (very short to very long) based on their learning needs and time constraints.
    *   **Progressive Hint Generation:** Offers structured, step-by-step hints generated by the same **Phi 1.5 model** to help students solve problems and understand concepts.
*   **Smart Text Handling:** Automatically normalizes uppercase, lowercase, and mixed case input for better AI understanding and response quality.
*   **Interactive and Structured Content Delivery:** Presents the curriculum (topics, subtopics, concepts) in a clear, navigable, and engaging interface, making self-directed learning intuitive.
*   **Detailed Progress Tracking:** Systematically records student performance data, including answers, time taken, hints used, and mastery levels, allowing students (and teachers) to monitor learning progress.
*   **Modern User Interface:** Both **command-line interface (CLI)** and **graphical user interface (GUI)** options for different user preferences and hardware capabilities.

### 2. Teacher and Community-Facing Features (Teacher Tools)

*   **Comprehensive Content Management & Editing (CLI Editor):** A robust command-line interface specifically designed for educators and content experts to create, modify, validate, and organize the structured educational content (JSON files). This tool enforces the defined content schema to maintain data integrity.
*   **Student Progress Analytics & Reporting:** Enables teachers to generate detailed reports and gain analytical insights into individual student performance, class progress, common areas of difficulty, and overall learning trends.
*   **Automated Content Validation:** Integrates automated checks (including JSON schema validation) to ensure the technical correctness and structural integrity of the educational content contributed or modified.
*   **Support for Collaborative Content Development:** The workflow and tools are designed to facilitate contributions and review processes within the community, ensuring the content remains up-to-date and high-quality.
