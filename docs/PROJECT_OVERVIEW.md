# Satya Project Overview: An Offline-First, RAG-Powered AI Learning Companion for Nepali students

## Executive Summary

Satya is a pioneering educational technology initiative aimed at bridging educational disparities for students in Nepal, particularly in areas with limited or no internet connectivity. This project delivers an **offline-first, RAG-powered learning companion** designed to cover the Computer Science, Science, and English curricula. By leveraging a **single lightweight Phi 1.5 AI model** and **intelligent content discovery through RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, Satya provides interactive learning experiences, and valuable tools for both students and teachers, all operating efficiently on **low-end hardware**.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to empower the next generation of Nepali students by providing accessible, high-quality educational resources regardless of their geographical location or access to online infrastructure. We aim to democratize learning through **intelligent, RAG-enhanced technology** and foster a collaborative environment for content development and continuous improvement, ultimately contributing to enhanced educational outcomes across Nepal.

## Key Objectives

The Satya project is guided by the following core objectives:

1.  **Maximize Accessibility:** Ensure the learning companion is fully functional offline and requires minimal system resources to run on commonly available computers. Provide comprehensive support for both English and Nepali languages to cater to diverse student needs and promote inclusivity.
2.  **Deliver High-Quality Education:** Offer comprehensive coverage of the Grade 10 curriculum with engaging, interactive content designed for effective learning. Implement **RAG-enhanced content discovery** and robust progress tracking mechanisms to personalize the learning experience and address individual student needs.
3.  **Empower Teachers:** Provide intuitive and efficient tools for teachers to manage educational content, monitor student progress at both individual and class levels, and gain actionable insights through analytics, thereby enhancing their capacity to deliver effective instruction and targeted support.
4.  **Foster Community Collaboration:** Establish a transparent and streamlined platform and workflow for community members, particularly subject matter experts and educators, to contribute to, rigorously validate, and continuously update the educational content, ensuring its accuracy, relevance, and pedagogical soundness.

## Core Features

The Satya system is architected around several key features designed to provide a comprehensive and effective learning ecosystem:

### 1. Student-Facing Features (CLI & GUI Learning Applications)

*   **Offline Content and Functionality:** Guarantees uninterrupted access to all educational materials and AI functionalities without any requirement for internet connectivity, crucial for low-connectivity regions.
*   **RAG-Enhanced AI-Powered Learning Assistance:**
    *   **Intelligent Content Discovery:** Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to find the most relevant study materials for any question, even with vague or incomplete queries.
    *   **Contextual Question Answering (Q&A):** Provides accurate and relevant answers to student queries using **Phi 1.5 model** with retrieved RAG context for enhanced accuracy.
    *   **Answer Length Control:** Students can choose from **5 different detail levels** (very short to very long) based on their learning needs and time constraints.
    *   **Progressive Hint Generation:** Offers structured, step-by-step hints generated by the same **Phi 1.5 model** to help students solve problems and understand concepts.
*   **Smart Text Handling:** Automatically normalizes uppercase, lowercase, and mixed case input for better AI understanding and response quality.
*   **Interactive and Structured Content Delivery:** Presents the curriculum (topics, subtopics, concepts) in a clear, navigable, and engaging interface, making self-directed learning intuitive.
*   **Detailed Progress Tracking:** Systematically records student performance data, including answers, time taken, hints used, and mastery levels, allowing students (and teachers) to monitor learning progress.
*   **Modern User Interface:** Both **command-line interface (CLI)** and **graphical user interface (GUI)** options for different user preferences and hardware capabilities.

### 2. Teacher and Community-Facing Features (Teacher Tools)

*   **Comprehensive Content Management & Editing (CLI Editor):** A robust command-line interface specifically designed for educators and content experts to create, modify, validate, and organize the structured educational content (JSON files). This tool enforces the defined content schema to maintain data integrity.
*   **Student Progress Analytics & Reporting:** Enables teachers to generate detailed reports and gain analytical insights into individual student performance, class progress, common areas of difficulty, and overall learning trends.
*   **Automated Content Validation:** Integrates automated checks (including JSON schema validation) to ensure the technical correctness and structural integrity of the educational content contributed or modified.
*   **Support for Collaborative Content Development:** The workflow and tools are designed to facilitate contributions and review processes within the community, ensuring the content remains up-to-date and high-quality.
